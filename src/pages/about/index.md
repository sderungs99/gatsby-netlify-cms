## Who am I?

* Husband to a beautiful wife
* Father to two awesome kids
* Technologist
* Constant learner

## Why did I create a blog?

This blog is part of my 2019 resolutions, where I would like to become a better software engineer and therefore a more hands-on technologist. In order to make myself accountable, I intend to start this blog to document the progress for that goal. In the long run, my hope is that this blog will turn into a "BAU" process for me, where I would talk about my learnings both on the technology side, but also on any other self-improvements that I am making.

## What is my professional career?

* Engineer (A long long time ago... ColdFusion, anyone?)
* Technical Project and Program Manager
* IT engineering lead, agile transformation lead, technical product owner, etc. (yes, my current role is somewhat cumbersome, and I am struggling to properly define it...)
