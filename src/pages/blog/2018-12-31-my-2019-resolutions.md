* Contribute to any open source project
* Become a member of a scrum team (permanent? Floater? “Whenever I have time”?)
* Become a more hands-on engineer (focus on a technology? Which one?)
* Start a blog to document progress
* Blog about the agile transformation of my team
* Properly define my role and agree it with my managers
* Become a better coach/mentor for my direct reports (regular 1:1 with all of them, focusing on their career and not about their day to day work progress)
* Start writing TS instead of JS (look at TS section here: https://leclan.ch/posts/re-things-i-dont-know/)

In a next blog post, I will prioritise them and provide some more details around each of them.
