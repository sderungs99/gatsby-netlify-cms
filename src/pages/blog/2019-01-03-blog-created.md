While I continue to work on exactly defining and prioritising my 2019 resolutions, I went ahead and created by first blog. I read a lot about about GatsbyJS and done some prototypes with it at work, so it was clear to me that I want to use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to build my own blog. It truly was extremely easy to create it (and yes, it also is blazing fast!). It literally requires a single ["click-on-a-button"](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms), and you are being guided through a process to create a blog, using GatsbyJS, which is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This, however, was the easy part. Now the hard part (but also the fun part) will have to follow:

* Update the design to make it more personal (currently, it is using the NetlifyCMS default template)
* Write blog entries!

For documentation purposes, I am attaching some screenshots of this first version of my blog.
