As mentioned in my [2018 retrospective entry](https://www.sascha.site/blog/2019-01-12-retrospective-on-my-year-of-2018/), I want to focus on Meditation and Mindfulness this year. First stop: Reading [THE HEADSPACE GUIDE TO MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250104904/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1250104904&linkCode=as2&tag=jasonguti07-20&linkId=f073156382922fdfe8ea8bc8fe21a4ba).

I completed the first chapter, and can say that I am pretty much convinced that, if done properly, this will have a big impact on me. Here are a few quotes from the book, that totally resonated with me:

> At the time I just really struggled with my mind. Not in a straightjacket kind of way you understand, but I struggled with the endless thinking. It felt as if my mind was permanently switched on, going round and round like a washing machine. Some of the thoughts I liked. A lot of the thoughts I didn't like. The same was true of the emotions.

Or:

> I felt as though I was always drifting into unnecessary worry, frustration and sadness.

Or:

> And then there are those who turn to mediation as a way of improving their relationships with partners, parents, children, frineds, colleagues and associates.

And finally:

> Mindfulness is about learning how to change your experience of that lifestyle. It's about finding a way to live as you are but with an underlying sense of fulfilment.

## What's next?

I cannot wait for next chapter, which I believe will talk in more details about the approach. I am planning to create another blog entry, when I am done with that chapter.
