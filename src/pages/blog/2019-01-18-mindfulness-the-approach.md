## Insight 1

Imagine your mind is a highway with many lanes, and you are sitting at the side of the highway, easily watching your thoughts (i.e. vehicles) pass by.

## Insight 2

The mind is the sky. Your thoughts are the clouds. There can be heavy clouds, light clouds, white clouds, dark-grey clouds, but at the end, and as we all know what happens when you fly in a plane, the sky is always blue, no matter how many clouds are beneath it.

## Insight 3

Don't try to desperately hold on to good experience, and embrace bad experiences. This can be done by consciously thinking that when you have a good experience, you share it with others, whereas when you have a bad experience you would imagine that you would hold these bad experiences for someone else that you care for, so that that person does not have to experience this.

## The Practice

The next blog post will be more details about the next chapter in the book: The Approach.
