## Insight 1

Imagine your mind is a highway with many lanes, and you are sitting at the side of the highway, easily watching your thoughts (i.e. vehicles) pass by.

## Insight 2

The mind is the sky. Your thoughts are the clouds. There can be heavy clouds, light clouds, white clouds, dark-grey clouds, but at the end, and as we all know what happens when you fly in a plane, the sky is always blue, no matter how many clouds are beneath it.

## Insight 3

Don't try to desperately hold on to good experience, and embrace bad experiences. This can be done by consciously thinking that when you have a good experience, you share it with others, whereas when you have a bad experience you would imagine that you would hold these bad experiences for someone else that you care for, so that that person does not have to experience this.

The Practice

The next blog post will be more details about the next chapter in the book: The Approach.

## "Take10"

This is the section in the book, where it explains the approach of taking just 10 minutes every day and mediate. For my own learnings, here is the summary, copied straight from the book:

### Getting ready:

1. Find a place to sit down comfortably, keeping a straight back.
2. Ensure you'll be left undisturbed during your mediation (switch off your mobile).
3. Set the time for 10 minutes

### Checking-in:

1. Take 5 deep breaths, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth oand then gently close your eyes.
2. Focus on the physical sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor.
3. Scan down through the body and notice which parts feel comfortable and relaxed, and which parts feel uncomfortable and tense.
4. Notice how you're feeling - i.e. what sort of mood you're in right now.

### Focusing the mind:

1. Notice where you feel the rising and falling sensation of the breath most strongly.
2. Notice how each breath feels, thr rhythm of it - whether it's long or short, deep or shallow, roguh or smooth.
3. Gently count the breaths as you focus on the rising and falling sensation - 1 with the rise and 2 with the fall, upwards to a count of 10.
4. Repeat this cycle between 5 and 10 times, or for as long as you have time available.

### Finishing-off:

1. Let go of any focus at all, allowing the mind to be as busy or as still as it wants to be for about 20 seconds.
2. Bring the mind back to the sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor.
3. Gently open your eyes and stand up when you feel ready.

My first few tries:

In my next blog entry, I will write about my experience of my first few attempts following the "Take10" approach mentioned above
