For the last week, I have been spending 10 minutes every day, trying to meditate using the what I have learned from [the book about Mindfulness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250104904/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1250104904&linkCode=as2&tag=jasonguti07-20&linkId=f073156382922fdfe8ea8bc8fe21a4ba) so far.

## What are the challenges I have?

* When and where to do it? When I am not at work, I did it during my younger son's nap time in the afternoon, or after he has fallen asleep. At office, I was looking for a free phone booth and went there after lunch.
* I feel my thoughts are quite often going into the direction about "how much longer until 10 minutes are over"? I guess as long as I am mindful and aware of these thoughts, and I gently bring them back to focusing on my breath, I guess there is nothing wrong with that. Also, with time, I think these kind of thoughts will go away.
* Counting to 10 with my breath is difficult! As described in the book, I often realize that I count beyond 10. I am trying to take this with a certain humour, instead of getting frustrated about it, also like it is described and recommended in the book.

## How do I feel? Do I notice any changes about my mind?

I may be wrong (and I hope it is not just wishful thinking), but I do feel the in general I am more at ease with myself. I definitely want to continue to practice and I am very curious about the next chapter in the book, which will talk about how to integrate Mindfulness into the everyday life!
